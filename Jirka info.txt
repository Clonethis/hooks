Redux 
- is like policy maker
- takes claims from customers and after keen look on claim by each deparment (they will decide, if they want to do something
with the policy or nothing)
some analogy with insurance company ->
Person dropping off a form -> form -> form receiver -> departments ->compiled department data(usefull data after work done)
in Redux
action creator->action->dispatch->Reducers->State

-action creator -> create form
-action -> describes changes that need to be made
dispatch -> copies object and pass to reducers
Reducers -> separate own data - process data diferrently then other Reducers -> when return data send to State
State -> central repository -> everything can easily acces State
* modelling insurance company

-> 230 + 
--> completely different setup than with react -> more complex but with bigger app it makes much more sense
index.js in -> src\Components\Redux\app\actions  ->
because more usability with Redux..

! also need to : npm install redux react-redux -> for installing redux
for exporting default redux components -> export default connect()(SongList);
-- two parenteses due to first calling function and second invoking called function -> Calling 'connect' and
calling 'SongList' => Function in function
