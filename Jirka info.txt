Redux 
- is like policy maker
- takes claims from customers and after keen look on claim by each deparment (they will decide, if they want to do something
with the policy or nothing)
some analogy with insurance company ->
Person dropping off a form -> form -> form receiver -> departments ->compiled department data(usefull data after work done)
in Redux
action creator->action->dispatch->Reducers->State

-action creator -> create form
-action -> describes changes that need to be made
dispatch -> copies object and pass to reducers
Reducers -> separate own data - process data diferrently then other Reducers -> when return data send to State
State -> central repository -> everything can easily acces State
* modelling insurance company
